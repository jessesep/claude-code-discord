# Cursor Integration Test

✅ **Cursor integration is working successfully!**

This file was created by the autonomous coding agent powered by Cursor to confirm that:

- File creation capabilities are functional
- The agent can write to the workspace
- Communication between Cursor and the coding agent is operational

**Test completed on:** Tuesday, January 6, 2026

## Model and Capabilities

### AI Model
**Claude Sonnet 4.5** - An advanced AI assistant powered by Anthropic's latest language model, optimized for coding tasks and technical problem-solving.

### Core Capabilities

#### 1. **Code Manipulation**
- Read, write, and modify files across the entire workspace
- Support for multiple programming languages and file formats
- Syntax-aware code editing with context preservation
- Batch operations for efficient multi-file changes

#### 2. **Development Tools**
- **Shell Commands**: Execute terminal commands with proper sandboxing
- **Git Operations**: Full git workflow support (status, diff, commit, branch management)
- **Search Tools**: Semantic search for understanding code, grep for exact matches, glob for file patterns
- **File Operations**: Create, read, update, delete files and directories

#### 3. **Project Understanding**
- Semantic code search to find functionality by meaning, not just text
- Cross-file analysis and dependency tracking
- Pattern recognition across large codebases
- Context-aware suggestions based on existing code patterns

#### 4. **Task Management**
- Break down complex tasks into manageable steps
- Track progress through multi-step operations
- Parallel tool execution for improved efficiency
- Automatic error detection and recovery

#### 5. **Context Window**
- **1 million tokens** of context
- Can maintain understanding of large codebases
- Automatic context management with seamless handoffs when needed
- Persistent task tracking across context boundaries

#### 6. **Best Practices**
- Follows language-specific conventions and idioms
- Implements modern design patterns
- Considers security, performance, and maintainability
- Provides clean, well-structured code

### Limitations
- Cannot execute long-running processes or background services
- Requires explicit permissions for network operations and git writes
- Works within sandbox constraints for security
- Relies on tool availability in the environment

### Integration Features
This bot can receive commands via Discord and execute them through Cursor's agent interface, enabling remote development workflows and collaborative coding assistance.
