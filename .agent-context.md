# one agent discord - Agent Context

## 🎯 Mission
A sophisticated Discord-based AI coding assistant orchestrating specialized subagents. Unified broker for multi-agent workflows, Git operations, and system management. This project is branded as **one agent discord** (lowercase, no hyphens in display name).

## 📂 Compartments
To maintain architectural focus, use the compartment-level context files:
- [**Agent**](file:///Users/jessesep/repos/claude-code-discord/agent/.agent-context.md): Orchestration, registry, and subagent management.
- [**Discord**](file:///Users/jessesep/repos/claude-code-discord/discord/.agent-context.md): Bot interface, commands, and interaction UI.
- [**Claude/Engine**](file:///Users/jessesep/repos/claude-code-discord/provider-clients/.agent-context.md): LLM provider abstraction and streaming.
- [**Utility**](file:///Users/jessesep/repos/claude-code-discord/util/.agent-context.md): Shared services, Git, GitHub, and Memory bridges.

## 🏆 Golden Standards
1. **Branding First**: This project is **one agent discord** (lowercase). Use this name in all comments, headers, docs, and user-facing strings. Never use "Claude Code Discord Bot" or similar legacy names.
2. **Always read context first**: Your VERY FIRST action MUST be to use the `view_file` tool to read the root `.agent-context.md` and the context file of your working compartment.
3. **Agent Instance Isolation**: Every spawned agent MUST have:
   - A unique **Agent Instance ID**: `{agentType}-{channelPrefix}-{timestamp}-{random}`
   - **Hard channel binding**: Agents can ONLY respond in their bound channel (no crosstalk)
   - **Isolated context window**: Each instance maintains its own conversation history
   - See `agent/instance-registry.ts` for the canonical implementation
4. **Manager-Subagent Flow**: The Manager assesses complexity and spawns specific agents (Coder, Architect, etc.) for heavy lifting.
5. **Interactive UX**: Prefer Discord embeds and buttons over raw text for a premium feel.
6. **Memory Dependency**: Use `claude-mem` tools (search/timeline) to maintain continuity across long-lived coding tasks.

## 🧠 Memory & Tools
This repo is heavily integrated with `claude-mem`.
- Use `search(query="...", project="claude-code-discord")` to find previous bugfixes or architectural decisions.
- Follow the patterns in `CLAUDE.md` for build/test commands.

## 🛠 Improvement Tasks
- [x] Refine "Golden Standards" for orchestration efficiency.
- [x] Create detailed `.agent-context.md` files for major functional directories.
- [ ] Document the primary data models (Sessions, Swarms) in the "Mission" sections.
- [ ] Audit `CLAUDE.md` to ensure command parity with latest features.
