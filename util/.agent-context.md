# Utility Compartment Context
> **Scope**: Cross-cutting concerns, system bridges, and helper services.

## 🎯 Mission
Provide shared logic and platform integrations. This compartment acts as the bridge between core agent logic and external systems like Git, GitHub, and the `claude-mem` memory engine.

## 🗺️ Key Filepaths
- `util/claude-mem-service.ts`: Primary bridge for interacting with the `claude-mem` worker API.
- `util/github-issues.ts`: Logic for parsing and creating GitHub issues via the API.
- `util/mcp-server.ts`: Registration and handling for internal MCP tools.
- `util/swarm-manager.ts`: Orchestration for multi-agent workflows (creating channels/categories).
- `util/settings-persistence.ts`: File-based storage for user-specific and system-wide settings.

## 🛠️ Key Dependencies
- `octokit`: For GitHub API interactions.
- `node-fetch`: For worker API communication.

## 📜 Conventions
- **Error Resilience**: Use the `handleGlobalError` pattern to prevent crashes from external API failures.
- **Path Neutrality**: Use utility functions to resolve filepaths across different operating systems/working directories.
- **Service Isolation**: Wrap complex external integrations (like GitHub) in dedicated service classes.

## 💡 Code Example: Memory Search Bridge
```typescript
export async function searchProjectHistory(query: string, project: string) {
  const service = new ClaudeMemService();
  return await service.search({ query, project });
}
```
